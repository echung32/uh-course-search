# Scheduled Metadata Refresh for Mutable Terms (design)

Status: **shipped**.

## What shipped

- Daily cron-triggered Cloudflare Workflow `uh-course-search-refresh` (cron `0 12 * * *` = 02:00 HST), defined in `web/wrangler.jsonc` `workflows` binding, class `RefreshWorkflow` in `web/src/workflows/refresh.ts`, Worker entry `web/src/worker.ts`.
- Orchestrator `web/src/lib/ingest/refresh.ts`: `refreshMutableTerms` (all non-view-only terms) and `refreshTerm` (single term) — Tier A full sync + Tier B1 diff-driven detail re-fetch + Tier B2 rolling detail safety net (see Hardening bullet below).
- Manual entry points: `POST /api/admin/refresh-run` (secret-guarded) and `yarn ingest refresh-run [--term 202710] [--delayMs 200]`.
- Section-core diff classifier in `web/src/lib/ingest/diff.ts` (new/dropped/structural CRNs; seat fields excluded).
- Migration `0008` (`web/migrations/0008_term_details_synced.sql`) added `term.last_details_synced_at` (since superseded and dropped by migration `0009` — see the Hardening bullet below).
- **Content-aware delta write** (`web/src/lib/ingest/diff.ts` `classifyForWrite` + `web/src/lib/db/upsert.ts` writers): Tier A writes only new/changed/dropped sections — seat-only changes UPDATE the row without rewriting child rows; unchanged sections are skipped — cutting D1 writes on the daily sweep. Per-row `synced_at` becomes last-modified; `term.last_synced_at` remains last-verified.
- **Hardening (post-merge):** the Workflow now runs **bounded steps per term** (enumerate subjects → one sync step per ~40-subject session-batch via `syncSubjectBatch` → finalize → details), and **Tier B2 is rolling** — each run refreshes the `REFRESH_ROLLING_DETAIL_CRNS` (default 250) stalest detail CRNs (`getStaleDetailCrns`, never-fetched first) instead of a >7-day full pass. Migration `0009` drops `term.last_details_synced_at` (the old full-pass gate; detail freshness is now `MIN(section_detail.synced_at)`). This removed the >7-day full-pass failure mode.
- **Hardening follow-up (details-step timeout, 2026-06-14):** the first hardened cron still errored — every hourly instance finished term #1's Tier A + finalize, then timed out on its single `details` step, so the remaining mutable terms (incl. the ~9k-section 202710) never refreshed and the site showed multi-day-stale freshness. Two root causes, both fixed: (1) Banner's `searchResults` `faculty[].bannerId` is an **ephemeral per-query id** (it shifts every fetch — proven: same instructor name/email, id +27 between two fetches seconds apart), but `structuralFingerprint` keyed faculty on it, so every section with an instructor was misclassified "structural" on every sync → a Tier B1 detail storm. The fingerprint now keys faculty on `emailAddress`/`displayName`. (2) The details phase is now **bounded into chunked steps**: `planTermDetailCrns` returns a deduped, per-run-capped (`REFRESH_ROLLING_DETAIL_CRNS`) B1∪rolling-stale set, which the Workflow fetches in `DETAIL_STEP_SIZE`-CRN `step.do`s, so no step nears the 10-min timeout regardless of CRN count. **Dormant follow-up:** the instructor/contact-card tables (`section_faculty`/`instructor`, `/api/instructor`) also key on the ephemeral `bannerId` (and `getContactCard` returns a *different* real `personData.bannerId`) — currently harmless because the details/instructor pass never ran in prod, but it needs a Tier-B fix (key instructors on a stable id/email) before that linkage is relied upon.
- **Cadence change to daily (2026-06-14):** once the timeout was fixed, a full run legitimately takes ~90 min (4 terms × bounded Tier A + chunked details). With the hourly cron, each fire spawned a new instance on top of the still-running prior one, so two instances re-synced the same top terms concurrently — duplicated Banner load and D1 writes — while the tail terms (`202643`/`202640`, last in `code DESC`) stayed starved. Switched the cron to **daily** (`0 12 * * *` = 02:00 HST): one fire completes all terms with 22+ h of headroom, so no overlap and no concurrency guard needed. Trade-off: seat/section freshness is now ≤24 h (was ≤1 h), and the rolling B2 detail window for the ~9k-section term stretches to ~37 days at the default 250-CRN cap — raise `REFRESH_ROLLING_DETAIL_CRNS` to shorten it (see Tier B2 below).
- **Seat-only refresh path removed (2026-06-14):** the standalone seat refresh (`ingest/seatRefresh.ts`, `POST /api/admin/refresh-seats`, `yarn ingest refresh-seats`, `term.last_seat_refresh_at` via migration `0010`, and the CoverageDialog "Last seat refresh" row) is deleted. The daily Tier A full sync re-pulls every section's seats, so seat freshness is exactly `term.last_synced_at` ("Verified against Banner") — a separate seat anchor was redundant and, in the scheduled (sync-only) model, perpetually "never" (it had no scheduled caller). The SIS primitive `getEnrollmentInfo` is **kept** for a future per-class refresh feature. The Tier-comparison and out-of-scope notes below are retained as the original rationale for why per-CRN seat refresh was never adopted for whole-term freshness.

## Problem

Nothing refreshes course metadata automatically. The Banner-facing write path is a set of
manually-invoked building blocks (`yarn ingest sync | sync-details | refresh-terms`,
and the `/api/admin/*` routes, which return 501 in production unless `INGEST_ON_WORKER=1`). There is
no cron, no GitHub Action — every refresh is a hand-run CLI command.

Confirmed against the remote D1 (100 terms): **`last_seat_refresh_at` is NULL for every term** — the
seat-refresh pipeline has never executed in production. The four non-view-only terms
(`is_view_only = 0`: currently `202713`, `202710` ≈ 9,170 sections, `202643`, `202640` ≈ 1,965) were
last synced 1–3 days ago and drift with no correction. Non-view-only terms are still mutating: seats,
waitlist, meeting times, instructors, descriptions, restrictions, and fees can all change.

## What each refresh actually costs (per endpoint)

This drives the whole design, so it is recorded explicitly. Costs are Banner HTTP requests.

| Refresh | Endpoint(s) | Cost | Updates | Volatility |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Full sync** (`ingest/sync.ts`) | `searchResults` paginated @ 500/page (+ `resetDataForm` per page) | **~2 per 500 sections** → ~200–400 for a 9k term | section core: title, **seats/enrollment/waitlist**, meeting times, faculty, credits, schedule type, attributes | seats=HIGH, rest=MED |
| **Seat refresh** (`ingest/seatRefresh.ts`) | `getEnrollmentInfo` | **1 per CRN** → ~9,170 for the big term | enrollment/seat/waitlist counts only | HIGH |
| **Details: catalog** (`ingest/details.ts`) | `getCatalogDetails` (+ description + prerequisites + corequisites when `text`) | **4 per *course*** (deduped to one representative CRN per campus+course) | college/dept/grading + description/prereqs/coreqs | LOW |
| **Details: section** | `getRestrictions` + `getFees` + `getCrossListSections` + `getLinkedSections` + `getSyllabus` | **5 per CRN** | restrictions, fees, cross-list, linked, syllabus | LOW |
| **Details: instructor** | `getContactCard` | **1 per distinct instructor** | contact card | LOW |
| **Filter options** | 10× `get_*` | 10 per term | dropdown menus | LOW |

Two facts that determine the strategy:

1. **The most volatile data (seats/waitlist) is the cheapest to refresh, and a full sync already
   carries it.** The `searchResults` row populates `enrollment/seatsAvailable/waitCount/...` — the
   exact fields `seatRefresh` patches. A full sync of the 9,170-section term costs ~200–400 requests
   and refreshes *all* seats; covering the same seats via per-CRN `getEnrollmentInfo` costs ~9,170
   requests (~25× more) for strictly less data. Per-CRN seat refresh only wins on a small targeted
   subset between syncs — not for whole-term freshness.
2. **The expensive data (~10 requests per section-equivalent: restrictions, fees, cross-list,
   descriptions, prereqs) is low-volatility** — it rarely changes once a term is published.

So the tiers are organized by **frequency-by-volatility**, not by "seats vs everything."

## Design

### Tier A — full sync, daily

Re-run `syncTerm` on every `is_view_only = 0` term once a day. ~1k requests total across the four
mutable terms; well inside paid limits; keeps seats/waitlist/meeting-times/faculty fresh to ≤24h.
Per-CRN seat refresh is **not** used for whole-term freshness (it is ~25× costlier for less data).

In the Workflow this runs as bounded steps: one `enumerateSyncSubjects` step then one `syncSubjectBatch` step per ~40-subject session-batch, so no single step approaches the 10-minute step timeout at any term size. `syncTerm` (CLI/admin) composes the same pieces.

### Tier B — re-freshing the expensive details

Tier B's job is the low-volatility detail endpoints (restrictions, fees, cross-list, linked,
syllabus, course text, instructor cards). Two complementary mechanisms:

**B1 — diff-driven (every run, cheap).** Tier A's full sync re-pulls every section's `raw_json`. The
sync write path is modified to diff the incoming section set against the existing rows *before* the
delete-and-replace, classifying each CRN:

- **new** (in the sync, absent from D1) → has no details; fetch its full detail set.
- **dropped** (in D1, absent from the sync) → delete its `section_detail`.
- **structurally changed** → re-fetch its details. "Structural" = a diff of the section-core fields
  *excluding* the always-moving seat/enrollment fields (`enrollment`, `seatsAvailable`, `waitCount`,
  `waitCapacity`, `waitAvailable`, `openSection`). Triggering fields: faculty, meeting times, title,
  schedule type, `sectionAttributes`, credit hours, link identifier.

Detail re-fetches reuse the existing per-CRN fetchers (`sectionLazy` / `courseTextLazy` / the
`details.ts` section/catalog fetchers).

**Known blind spot of B1.** Tier A's payload carries no Tier B field (`restrictions`, `fees`,
cross-list CRNs, `syllabus`, `reservedSeatSummary` is always `null` in search; course text is not in
a section row at all). So a fee/restriction/text edit on a section whose *core* did not move is
invisible to the diff. B2 closes this gap.

**B2 — rolling safety net.** Each run refreshes the K stalest detail CRNs for a term — `getStaleDetailCrns` orders `course_section LEFT JOIN section_detail` by `COALESCE(section_detail.synced_at, 0) ASC` (never-fetched first), bounded by `REFRESH_ROLLING_DETAIL_CRNS` (default 250, dashboard-editable). This is the only thing that catches the invisible detail/text edits, and it fills never-viewed details over time. At the **daily** cadence the default cap of 250/run cycles a small term in a single run, but the ~9k-section term takes ~37 runs ≈ 37 days to cover every detail once (9170 / 250). Raise `REFRESH_ROLLING_DETAIL_CRNS` (dashboard-editable) to shorten that window — e.g. 1500/run cycles the big term in ~6 days — at the cost of a longer detail phase (more `DETAIL_STEP_SIZE`-CRN steps) per run. Bounded per run, and the B1∪B2 detail set is fetched across multiple `DETAIL_STEP_SIZE`-CRN Workflow steps (`planTermDetailCrns` + chunked `details … chunk N` steps), so no single step nears the 10-min timeout — even when many CRNs need details.

### Orchestration — one cron-triggered Cloudflare Workflow

A `WorkflowEntrypoint` (`RefreshWorkflow`) triggered **daily** by a native cron schedule (no
separate `scheduled()` entrypoint). Workflows provide durable, resumable steps with per-step
retry/backoff — the right primitive for multi-hundred-request sweeps that must survive transient
Banner failures.

It runs on the Worker runtime, calling the existing `lib/ingest/*` functions directly. The
`INGEST_ON_WORKER` guard only gates the admin *HTTP routes*; a `WorkflowEntrypoint` is a separate
entry, so it runs regardless. The Node `yarn ingest` CLI is retained unchanged for manual and
historical-backfill use.

Per daily run:

1. **`refreshTerms`** (~1–2 requests) — recompute `is_view_only` and pick up new terms, so terms
   that flipped to view-only drop out of the sweep and new ones join.
2. **For each mutable term — Tier A** as bounded steps: an `enumerateSyncSubjects` step, then one `syncSubjectBatch` `step.do()` per ~40-subject session-batch (each its own SIS session — a session can't cross a step boundary anyway), then a `markTermSynced` finalize step. The diff (B1) is accumulated across batches from the steps' return values.
3. **Tier B B1** — fetch/delete/re-fetch details for the CRN sets from step 2.
4. **Tier B details (B1 + rolling B2)** — `planTermDetailCrns` builds the per-term detail set (new∪structural first, then `getStaleDetailCrns` rolling-stale fills the remaining budget; deduped, capped at `REFRESH_ROLLING_DETAIL_CRNS`), which is fetched across bounded `details … chunk N` `step.do`s. The CLI/admin path shares the same plan via `refreshTermDetails`.

`limits.subrequests` in `wrangler.jsonc` is raised (e.g. 50,000) to cover a worst-case term. CPU is a
non-issue — the work is almost entirely `await fetch()` to Banner (CPU caps at 5 min/invocation; the
sweep's CPU is negligible). Pacing between chunks is the deliberate Banner-politeness throttle, not a
platform constraint.

## Schema

- Migration `0008` added `last_details_synced_at`; migration `0009` **drops it again** — the rolling Tier B2 (above) superseded the >7-day full-pass boundary it gated. Detail freshness is now read directly from `MIN(section_detail.synced_at)` per term, no dedicated column.
- Diffing needs the pre-replace section set. The sync already reads and writes per `(term, subject)`,
  so the diff is computed in that write path from the rows being replaced — no extra storage or
  snapshot table required. (The write mechanism was subsequently optimized: rather than
  delete-and-replace, `syncTerm` now runs a content-aware delta via `classifyForWrite` in
  `diff.ts`, issuing only insert/update/delete statements for rows that actually changed — see the
  "What shipped" bullet above.)

## Verification

- **Unit** — the diff classifier (new / dropped / structural, with seat/enrollment fields excluded)
  and the rolling-B2 cursor (`getStaleDetailCrns` orders never-fetched details first and is bounded
  by `REFRESH_ROLLING_DETAIL_CRNS`).
- **e2e (chromium, against the mock SIS, extending `ingest.spec.ts`)** — a Workflow/refresh run:
  advances `last_synced_at`; refreshes a changed seat count; fetches details for a newly-appeared CRN;
  deletes details for a dropped CRN; **skips** a details re-fetch for a seat-only change (Tier A delta
  write); and rolls the stalest detail CRNs every run (Tier B2), filling details for a CRN that was
  never in any diff. The mock already reproduces Banner's stateful-form quirk, preserving the
  `resetDataForm` regression guard.

## Out of scope

- A manual "refresh now" button in the UI.
- Near-real-time seat counts and per-CRN seat top-ups between syncs — the daily full
  sync covers seats ~25× more cheaply, and tighter cadence risks tripping Banner's session throttle.
- Refreshing view-only (immutable) terms — by definition they no longer change.
