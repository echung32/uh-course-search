/**
 * Edge-response cache for the read API routes, backed by the Cloudflare Cache
 * API (`caches.default`). A cache hit serves the response without touching D1 at
 * all — this is what makes the read path scale with traffic instead of with the
 * D1 rows-read budget (see docs/plans/d1-read-optimization.md).
 *
 * Why the Cache API and not Workers KV: the cache is per data center but shared
 * by every isolate in it (our audience is effectively single-colo), it's free
 * and unmetered, and a search cache's high key cardinality would burn KV's
 * 1k-writes/day free tier on cache *fills* alone.
 *
 * Invalidation is by KEY VERSION, not purge (the Cache API has no global purge):
 * the term's sync timestamps are baked into the cache key, so a full sync or
 * seat refresh moves every reader to fresh keys and the stale entries simply age
 * out of the colo. The TTL is therefore only a garbage/staleness bound, not the
 * invalidation mechanism.
 *
 * Only responses for BACKFILLED terms are cached (termCacheProfile returns null
 * otherwise): dynamic terms mutate D1 on read (page cache / lazy fills), so
 * caching their responses would freeze the very coverage a request is meant to
 * grow.
 *
 * Disabled with EDGE_CACHE=0 (e2e sets it: the ingestion specs mutate D1 mid-run
 * and must observe fresh reads). Outside a Cloudflare runtime `caches` is absent
 * and every call transparently degrades to uncached.
